# Artists Theme

The Artists Theme is a one page portfolio for freelancers based on the original [Jekyll theme](//github.com/DevTips/Artists-Theme) by [Travis Neilson](//github.com/travisneilson) aka [DevTips](//www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners) and the many contributors. It's the result of a longer [video series](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI) made by him that is showing the hole developement process from the first designs to the final Jekyll theme. Consider to subscribe to his [YouTube channel](//www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners).

This Hugo theme features several content sections, like an about section  showing the level of your skills, a responsive portfolio hover effects, a gallery to present your client's opinions and a contact form.

## Contents

### Make the contact form working

Since this page will be static, you can use [formspree.io](//formspree.io/) as proxy to send the actual email. Each month, visitors can send you up to one thousand emails without incurring extra charges. Begin the setup by following the steps below:

1. Enter your email address under 'email' in the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-agency-theme/blob/master/examples/config.toml)
2. Upload the generated site to your server
3. Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
4. Click the confirm link in the email from [formspree.io](//formspree.io/)
5. You're done. Happy mailing!


### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server -w

Now enter `localhost:1313` in the address bar of your browser.
